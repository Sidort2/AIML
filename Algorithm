First Pass:

Current element is 23
The first element in the array is assumed to be sorted.
The sorted part until 0th index is : [23]
Second Pass:

Compare 1 with 23 (current element with the sorted part).
Since 1 is smaller, insert 1 before 23.
The sorted part until 1st index is: [1, 23]
Third Pass:

Compare 10 with 1 and 23 (current element with the sorted part).
Since 10 is greater than 1 and smaller than 23, insert 10 between 1 and 23.
The sorted part until 2nd index is: [1, 10, 23]
Fourth Pass:

Compare 5 with 1, 10, and 23 (current element with the sorted part).
Since 5 is greater than 1 and smaller than 10, insert 5 between 1 and 10.
The sorted part until 3rd index is: [1, 5, 10, 23]
Fifth Pass:

Compare 2 with 1, 5, 10, and 23 (current element with the sorted part).
Since 2 is greater than 1 and smaller than 5 insert 2 between 1 and 5.
The sorted part until 4th index is: [1, 2, 5, 10, 23]
Final Array:

The sorted array is: [1, 2, 5, 10, 23]
